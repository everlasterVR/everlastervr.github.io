TittyMagic has support for some actions to be triggered with [Keybindings](https://hub.virtamate.com/resources/keybindings.4400/). I highly recommend this plugin when in desktop mode - the Find Command binding allows quickly accessing lots of commands from VAM and plugins that integrate with it.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `TittyMagic.OpenUI_Control` | opens the plugin UI and navigates to the main window |
| `TittyMagic.OpenUI_ConfigureHardColliders` | opens the plugin UI, navigates to the main window and opens the Configure Hard Colliders screen |
| `TittyMagic.OpenUI_ConfigureColliderFriction` | opens the Skin Materials 2 tab |
| `TittyMagic.OpenUI_PhysicsParams` | opens the plugin UI and navigates to the Physics Params window |
| `TittyMagic.OpenUI_MorphMultipliers` | opens the plugin UI and navigates to the Morph Multipliers window |
| `TittyMagic.OpenUI_GravityMultipliers` | opens the plugin UI and navigates to the Gravity Multipliers window |
| `TittyMagic.AutoUpdateMassOn` | enables Auto-Update Mass |
| `TittyMagic.AutoUpdateMassOff` | disables Auto-Update Mass |
| `TittyMagic.CalculateBreastMass` | triggers recalibration and calculates breast mass |
| `TittyMagic.CalibratePhysicsAndMorphs` | triggers recalibration |
