## Getting Started

[Install the package](/docs/general/installing_addon_packages), start VAM, and add the plugin to a Person atom's Plugins tab.

The plugin's default settings are intended to work well in most situations.

Make sure your frame rate is sufficiently high and synchronized with VAM's physics rate - see [Physics Rate and Frame Rate](/docs/general/physics_rate_and_frame_rate) and [Performance](/docs/naturalis/v1_0/performance). Configure your setup correctly and you will get more out of the plugin!

## Basic Usage: Softness, Quickness and Mass

The softness, quickness and joint mass offset sliders are intended as easy and intuitive ways to change how the breasts and glutes should behave. They adjust many different settings in the background, affecting the overall physics, collision and morphing.

### Softness

Softness affects how easily breasts and glutes deform and jiggly they are. The effect of softness is much more noticeable when soft physics is enabled.

### Quickness

Quickness affects a few physics settings that determine how quickly breasts and glutes move.

### Mass

During calibration, mass is automatically calculated from an estimate of the volume of the breasts or glutes. The mass offset slider allows you to increase or decrease the mass relative to the calculated mass.

## Advanced Usage: Configuring Physics, Morphing and Collision

The sub-pages of this documentation go into detail about how to adjust physics parameters, gravity physics, how morphing works, and how to optimize collision physics.

Since the plugin's default settings are carefully balanced to produce good results in most situations, it's easy to make the behaviour worse by changing the settings. However, since every user has different preferences, digging deeper into the settings can be essential for making the most out of the plugin.
