This guide by MacGruber covers the basics of installing add-on packages or .var files: <https://hub.virtamate.com/resources/installing-var-packages-from-patreon.4010/>

## Key takeaways from the guide

1. Place the .var file in the VAM/AddonPackages folder
2. Do not extract the contents!
3. If the package does not have dependencies (e.g. most plugins), you can skip the Package Manager step
4. Check that your browser actually knows how to download .var files, as explained in the guide
