TittyMagic controls physics parameters, morphs and colliders automatically. Some values are controlled continuously, others are set once per calibration. The automatic adjustments have been carefully fine tuned with each other so that the resulting behavior for different softness and quickness values makes sense for a wide range of breast sizes.

In addition to automatic adjustments, there's a lot that can be manually configured and fine tuned.

TittyMagic is made obsolete by [Naturalis](/docs/naturalis) which includes BootyMagic and a newer version of TittyMagic in a single package.

## Getting Started

Save the var package to VaM/AddonPackages. In Virt-A-Mate, add the plugin to a Person atom's Plugins tab.

The plugin's default settings are intended to work well in most situations.

Make sure your frame rate is sufficiently high and synchronized with Virt-A-Mate's physics rate - see [Physics Rate and Frame Rate](/docs/general/physics_rate_and_frame_rate). Configure your setup correctly and you will get more out of the plugin!

> **Unpacking the var package is not recommended**. The package includes morphs that are best loaded on demand when the plugin is actually used in the scene. Additionally, unpacking makes it impossible to properly use the plugin as a dependency for any looks or scenes you might release yourself.
