TittyMagic is made obsolete by [Naturalis](/docs/naturalis) which includes BootyMagic and a newer version of TittyMagic in a single package.

## Getting Started

Save the var package to VAM/AddonPackages. In VAM, add the plugin to a Person atom's Plugins tab.

The plugin's default settings are intended to work well in most situations.

Make sure your frame rate is sufficiently high and synchronized with VAM's physics rate - see [Physics Rate and Frame Rate](/docs/general/physics_rate_and_frame_rate). Configure your setup correctly and you will get more out of the plugin!

> **Unpacking the var package is not recommended**. The package includes morphs that are best loaded on demand when the plugin is actually used in the scene. Additionally, unpacking makes it impossible to properly use the plugin as a dependency for any looks or scenes you might release yourself.
