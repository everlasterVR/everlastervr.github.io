These settings are intended as easy and intuitive ways to change how the breasts should behave. They adjust many different settings in the background, from physics parameter values and collider properties to how much of each morph value will be applied and how gravity affects breasts.

### Softness

A low softness value makes breasts immobile and rigid, like implants. A high value simulates natural breasts.

### Quickness

Quickness is for tweaking the speed at which breasts respond to forces and bounce back to their normal shape and position. It only affects physics parameter values.

### Mass

Mass is calculated from an approximation of breast volume. Everything that depends on breast size uses breast mass as a multiplier one way or another, e.g. the sizes of hard colliders get scaled with breast mass, as do the the values of most physics parameters and morphs.
