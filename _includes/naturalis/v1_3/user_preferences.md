User preferences are saved to the file preferences.json and loaded when the plugin is initialized.

They can be accessed from the bottom of the main window in TittyMagic and BootyMagic:

## Advanced Soft Physics Tab

The **Update Rate** affects the quality and performance impact of depth physics and local distortion physics. The setting is shared between BootyMagic and TittyMagic.

| Update Rate | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 20 Hz | Reduces performance impact slightly, but soft physics values update less frequently. |
| 30 Hz | Recommended for most users. |
| 40 Hz | Increases performance impact slightly. Might be worth as a default setting for very high end CPUs. |
| 60 Hz | Increases performance impact, and results in very accurate updates to soft physics values. |

The **Default Enabled** toggles are separate for BootyMagic and TittyMagic

## Calibration Tab
