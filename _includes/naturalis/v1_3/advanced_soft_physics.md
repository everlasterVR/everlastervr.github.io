The features here correspond to the toggles in the [main plugin window](../), and can be enabled/disabled by default in [user preferences](../user_preferences/).

Local Distortion Physics and Depth Physics both adjust soft physics dynamically (up to every physics update per every  soft physics joint). This has a slight performance impact which can be detrimental to the experience if you're not hitting a stable framerate.
