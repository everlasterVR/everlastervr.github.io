When the plugin UI is open, you can simulate gravity on the entire body (including clothes and hair):

This allows easily checking how things would look if you changed the person's pose, and helps verify that the current settings look they way you want in a given angle. This works in any pose, e.g. if the person is lying on the back and you simulate upward gravity, breasts will lift up towards the head.

The gravity simulation directions and the stop function are also available as triggerable actions in case you want to use them outside of the plugin UI.

If hidden, the menu stays hidden only for the current plugin session. To set it to hide by default, uncheck that option in [Naturalis User Preferences](../user_preferences/).
