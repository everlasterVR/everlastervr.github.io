Naturalis keeps track of changes that require calibration, and puts calibration to pending if such a change is detected. If you make some change and calibration is not put to pending, you can assume your change is already in effect and everything's working as intended.

Undoing all of the changes that require calibration will clear the pending calibration (except in some cases, e.g. when toggling soft physics).
