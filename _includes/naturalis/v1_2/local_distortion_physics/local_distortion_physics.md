Local Distortion Physics (**LDP**) enables soft physics to react to local skin **compression** and **stretching**.

It changes the values of soft physics parameters on individual soft joints based on the distances of those joints from their neighboring joints. When the distance decreases, the mesh is compressing at that joint, and when the distance increases, the mesh is stretching at that joint - in other words, there's local distortion in the mesh.
