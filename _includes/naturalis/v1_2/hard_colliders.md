**Hard colliders** are similar other colliders in the body, just specific to glutes and breasts. Naturalis repositions the hard colliders, automatically calibrates their properties, and exposes configuration options for them in the Hard Colliders tab.

- collider depth is increased for softer breasts/glutes (leaving a gap between the skin and collider)
- collider mass, spring and damper affect how the collider responds to collision and how much it will move the pectoral/glute joint

> **Tip**
> The interplay of physics and directional force morphing with hard colliders determines the overall collision behaviour. For example, adjusting the amount of morphing might require decreasing or increasing hard collider masses to keep the same feel to the collision physics.

## Glute Hard Colliders

BootyMagic uses 8 hard colliders per glute. Normally in VAM, these are only enabled when soft physics is off, but in BootyMagic they are always enabled to enhance the collision physics.

## Breast Hard Colliders

Breast hard colliders are the same five colliders per breast as those used by VAM normally. These are always enabled.
