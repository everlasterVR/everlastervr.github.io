### Target Profile Transition

The Target Profile Transition feature allows you to select a target profile or set the profile off state (essentially all sliders at zero) as the target, and then transition from the current profile to the target values using the Profile Transition % slider. The transition slider is a triggerable parameter specific to each clothing item/profile, and the selected target profile path as well as the percentage save with the profile preset file.

In simple terms: the "From" profile is the current profile, and the "To" profile is the target profile. At slider value 0, all of the adjustments are at the current profile's values. At slider value 100, all of the adjustments are at the target profiles values.

### Morph Transition Timer

Enabling/disabling the profile or the clothing item itself transitions the morphs smoothly along the Morph Transition timer. This slider only has an effect when the offsets in the Morph Adjustments tab are in use. The point of this is to ensure that the morph transition isn't instant and unrealistic.

### Set Profile Off When Undressing

Deactivates the profile when Undress is toggled on in the item's physics settings (if sim item).
