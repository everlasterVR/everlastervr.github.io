Naturalis has support for some actions to be triggered with [Keybindings](https://hub.virtamate.com/resources/keybindings.4400/) (Hub). I highly recommend this plugin when in desktop mode - the Find Command binding allows quickly accessing lots of commands from VAM and plugins that integrate with it.
