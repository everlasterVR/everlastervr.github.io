The main controls for collider friction are in the Skin Materials 2 tab. These controls affect both hard colliders and colliders of the soft physics mesh simultaneously.

In addition, in the plugin's Physics tab, you can adjust Fat Collider Friction (affects only colliders of the soft physics mesh) along a gradient or based on local distortions in the mesh.
