### Default Clothing Profile For Custom Item

Clothing creators can include a default clothing adjustment profile for their clothing items inside the item's var package. This profile will be automatically applied when users use the clothing item. (Naturalis is not required as a dependency of the clothing var package, but is obviously required for the profile to be loaded.) See [Profile Locations](../clothing/#profile-locations).

In addition, clothing creators should ensure their items are correctly tagged to ensure they are detected correctly by the plugin. See [Identified Items And Tagging](../clothing/#identified-items-and-tagging).
