When the plugin UI is open, you can apply gravity on the entire body (including clothes and hair):

This allows easily checking how things would look if you changed the person's pose, and helps verify that the current settings look they way you want in a given angle. The force is simulated relative to the chest angle (in the case of TittyMagic) or hip angle (in the case of BootyMagic), so e.g. if the person is lying on the back and you simulate upward gravity, breasts will lift up towards the head.

The menu can be hidden with the < button (stays only for the current plugin session).

The gravity simulation directions and the stop function are also available as triggerable actions in case you want to use them outside of the plugin UI.
