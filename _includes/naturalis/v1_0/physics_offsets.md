All physics parameters can be manually offset from the value calculated during calibration.

The offset is the same absolute value regardless of what the calculated base value is. Example: if you apply an offset of +10 spring, and you reduce softness which will also reduce the base spring, you still have +10 spring offset, but it'll be proportionally a larger offset relative to the new base value.

> **Tip: Applying Only To Left Glute/Breast**<br/>
> When this option is enabled, the parameter's offset only applies to the left glute or breast, allowing you to compare the original behaviour with the changed behaviour side by side. The right glute or breast will use the calculated base value for the offset.
