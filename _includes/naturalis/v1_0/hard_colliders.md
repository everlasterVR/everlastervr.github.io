**Hard colliders** are similar other colliders in the body, just specific to glutes and breasts. Naturalis automatically adjusts the properties of hard colliders, and exposes configuration options for them in the Hard Colliders tab.

The plugin calibrates collider sizes and positions based on the estimated volume, but you might need to adjust them manually for optimal results with a specific glute or breast shape. The more accurately you can fit the colliders to the shape of the glute or breast, the better.

Hard colliders have mass which contributes inertia to the glute or breast joint. Also, reducing this mass diminishes the impact of hard colliders on the joint's movement.

## Glute Hard Colliders

BootyMagic uses 8 hard colliders per glute. Normally in VAM, these are only enabled when soft physics is off, but in BootyMagic they are always enabled to enhance the collision physics.

## Breast Hard Colliders

Breast hard colliders are the same five colliders per breast as those used by VAM normally.

The main purpose of breast hard colliders is to make them easier to move when touched. However, by default in VAM  hard colliders have too much effect and make breasts bounce at the slightest touch. TittyMagic drastically reduces the mass of hard colliders, decreasing the force that the colliders impart on the breast joint. In addition, all colliders are smaller and repositioned so that they fit inside the breast and fill most of the breast's volume.

The interplay of physics and directional force morphing with hard colliders determines the overall collision behaviour. For example, adjusting the amount of morphing might require decreasing or increasing hard collider masses to keep the same feel to the collision physics.

> **Note:** Unlike in VAM normally, breast hard colliders in Naturalis are always enabled.
