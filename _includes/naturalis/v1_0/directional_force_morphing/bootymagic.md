| Slider | Explanation | Trigger target |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Base Multiplier** | Multiplies all of the other slider values. | `Force Morphing Base Multiplier` |
| **Up** | The amount that the glute moves upward when there's a force acting upward along the hip, or when the glute joint rotates and causes the glute mesh to move up relative to the joint. | `Force Morphing Up` |
| **Down** | The amount that the glute moves downward when there's a force acting downward along the hip, or when the glute joint rotates and causes the glute mesh to move down relative to the joint. | `Force Morphing Down` |
| **Depth Out** | The amount that the glute stretches out when there's a force (e.g. gravity) pulling it out from the hip. Currently, collision alone can't cause forward morphing. | `Force Morphing Depth Out` |
| **Depth Out** | The amount that the glute flattens and expands when there's a force (e.g. gravity) pushing it into the hip. | `Force Morphing Depth In` |
| **Sideways In** | The amount that the glute moves and rotates inward towards the middle. A change can be caused by collision, by leaning in the direction of the morphing, or by some other sideways force. | `Force Morphing Sideways In` |
| **Sideways Out** | The amount that the glute moves and rotates outward. A change can be caused by collision, by leaning in the direction of the morphing, or by some other sideways force. | `Force Morphing Sideways Out` |
