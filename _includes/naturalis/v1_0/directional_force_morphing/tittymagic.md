| Slider | Explanation | Trigger target |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Base Multiplier** | Multiplies all of the other slider values. | `Force Morphing Base Multiplier` |
| **Up** |  The amount that the breast shifts, rotates and bulges upward when pushed up, when leaning forward or back, when upside down, or if there's some other upward force. | `Force Morphing Up` |
| **Depth Out** | The amount that the breast stretches out when leaning forward, or if there's some forward-back force causing the distance between the tip and chest to increase. Currently, collision alone can't cause depth out morphing. | `Force Morphing Depth Out` |
| **Depth In** | The amount that the breast compresses and spreads when pushed back, when leaning back, or if there's some forward-back force causing the distance between the tip and chest to decrease. | `Force Morphing Depth In` |
| **Sideways In** | The amount that the breast shifts, rotates and bulges inward towards the center gap. A change can be caused by collision, by leaning in the direction of the morphing, or by some other sideways force. | `Force Morphing Sideways In` |
| **Sideways Out** | The amount that the breast shifts, rotates and bulges outward towards the armpit/ribs. A change can be caused by collision, by leaning in the direction of the morphing, or by some other sideways force. | `Force Morphing Sideways Out` |
