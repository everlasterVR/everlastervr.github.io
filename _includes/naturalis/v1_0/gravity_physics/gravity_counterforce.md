Gravity counterforce is an extra setting on the Glute Joint Mass and Breast Joint Mass physics parameters. It allows for decoupling mass from weight by applying a force opposite to the direction of gravity. With gravity counterforce, we can reduce the weight of the joint without affecting the inertia supplied by mass. It gives the joint support that reduces droop/sag.

Gravity counterforce is a percentage of the force of gravity, so at 100% it cancels out all of the joint's weight.

In Bootymagic, the counterforce is automatically quite high because the butt doesn't simply hang off of the person's skeleton. In reality, most of the weight of the butt is supported by the surrounding muscles and skin around it, and the counterforce simulates that.

In TittyMagic, there's much less gravity counterforce by default.
