In TittyMagic, the dynamic adjustments of gravity physics are augmented with directional force physics which adjusts a few parameters based on the breast's depth. This is not configurable in the plugin UI, but there are multipliers that are exposed to triggers which can be used to adjust the magnitude of the effect. You can observe the effect in the physics parameter's view in the Physics Params tab when the breast is moving.

| Triggerable Parameter | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `Force Physics Base Multiplier` | Combined multiplier for force physics. |
| `Force Physics Depth In` | Multiplier when the breast is pushed in |
| `Force Physics Depth Out` | Multiplier when the breast is pulled out. |

| Physics Parameter | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Center of Gravity | Center of gravity increases slightly when the breast is pulled out further from the chest, and decreases slightly when the breast is pushed back into the chest. |
| In/Out Damper | In/out damper reduces when the breast is pulled out or pushed. The effect is greater the softer the breasts. |
| Fat Spring | Fat spring increases when the breast is pulled out and decreases when it is pushed in. The effect is greater the softer the breasts. |
