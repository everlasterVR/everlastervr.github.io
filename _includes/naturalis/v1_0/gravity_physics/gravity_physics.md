**Gravity physics** is the adjustment of a few physics parameters based on the angle of the glute or breast joint relative to ground, i.e. relative to the direction of gravity. Additionally, a **Gravity Counterforce** is applied on the Mass parameter to counteract the effect of gravity without reducing mass.
