### BootyMagic

| Physics Parameter | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Spring | Spring is at its base value when upright, e.g. when the person is standing up. When leaning back, left, right or when upside down, spring is reduced. When leaning forward (gravity applies towards the hip), spring is increased.
| In/Out Spring | In/Out Spring decreases when leaning forward or back. |
| Up/Down Angle Target | Up/Down Angle Target is negative when upright, causing glutes to get pulled down more heavily, and positive when upside down, causing them to be pulled up more heavily. |
| Left/Right Angle Target | Left/Right Angle Target pulls the glutes sideways towards the direction of gravity. |

### TittyMagic

| Physics Parameter | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Spring | Spring is at its base value when upright, e.g. when the person is standing up. When leaning forward, left, right or when upside down, spring is reduced. When leaning back (gravity applies towards the chest), spring is increased.
| Damper | Damper increases when leaning forward or back, or when the breast rotates sideways inward. |
| In/Out Spring | In/Out Spring decreases when leaning forward or back. |
| Up/Down Angle Target | Up/Down Angle Target is negative when upright, causing breasts to get pulled down more heavily, and positive when upside down, causing them to be pulled up more heavily. |
| Left/Right Angle Target | Left/Right Angle Target pulls the breasts sideways towards the direction of gravity. |

> **Tip: Compensate for droop with morphing**<br/>
> In the Morphs tab, you can compensate for the droop caused by the Up/Down Angle Target with the Gravity Offset Morphing slider. By default, TittyMagic applies roughly the amount of offset morphing that's equivalent to the angle being 0.
