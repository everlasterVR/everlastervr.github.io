- Physics parameter offsets are not applied, except for Angle Targets (the default physics values differ too much with Naturalis)
- Like other physics parameter offsets, Mass Offset is not applied (mass calculation is different in Naturalis)
- Quickness is converted from the 0 to 100 range to the -1 to 1 range, with 70 in TittyMagic corresponding to 0 in Naturalis
- Auto-Adjust Gravity Counterforce is enabled after the upgrade (as it is by default in Naturalis)
- Local Distortion Physcis is disabled after the upgrade (even if you have it enabled by default in Naturalis User Preferences)
- The overall gravity physics multipliers are converted to physics parameter specific gravity multipliers
- Everything else should be applied as is - softness, soft physics on/off, self-collision on/off, adaptive friction, nipple erection, gravity offset morphing and hard collider properties
