LDP has a slight performance impact which can be detrimental to the experience if you're not hitting a stable framerate. Therefore it's disabled by default, but in **Naturalis User Preferences**, you can set it to be enabled by default when soft physics is enabled.

In the user preferences, **LDP Update Rate** is set to 30 Hz by default. This results in a good balance between responsiveness and performance.

| Update Rate | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 20 Hz | Reduces performance impact slightly, but soft physics values update less frequently. |
| 30 Hz | Recommended for most users. |
| 40 Hz | Increases performance impact slightly. Might be worth as a default setting for very high end CPUs. |
| 60 Hz | Increases performance impact, and results in very accurate updates to soft physics values. |
