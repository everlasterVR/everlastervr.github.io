Normally, breasts and glutes are only calibrated for the shape that they are in when the person is standing up and gravity is acting downward along the chest or hip.

However, when Local Distortion Physics is enabled, calibration is multidirectional and takes a bit longer. This is because the neutral shape of the soft physics mesh needs to be calibrated for different directions of gravity. This way, deformations in the mesh due to forces other than gravity can be detected regardless of the person's pose.
