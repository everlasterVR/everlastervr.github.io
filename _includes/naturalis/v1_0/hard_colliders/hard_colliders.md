**Hard colliders** are similar other colliders in the body, just specific to glutes and breasts. Naturalis automatically adjusts the properties of hard colliders, and exposes configuration options for them in the Hard Colliders tab.

The plugin calibrates collider sizes and positions based on the estimated volume, but you might need to adjust them manually for optimal results with a specific glute or breast shape. The more accurately you can fit the colliders to the shape of the glute or breast, the better.

Hard colliders have mass which contributes inertia to the glute or breast joint. Also, reducing this mass diminishes the impact of hard colliders on the joint's movement.
