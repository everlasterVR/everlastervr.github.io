Breast hard colliders are the same five colliders per breast as those used by VAM normally.

The main purpose of breast hard colliders is to make them easier to move when touched. However, by default in VAM  hard colliders have too much effect and make breasts bounce at the slightest touch. TittyMagic drastically reduces the mass of hard colliders, decreasing the force that the colliders impart on the breast joint. In addition, all colliders are smaller and repositioned so that they fit inside the breast and fill most of the breast's volume.

The interplay of physics and directional force morphing with hard colliders determines the overall collision behaviour. For example, adjusting the amount of morphing might require decreasing or increasing hard collider masses to keep the same feel to the collision physics.

> **Note:** Unlike in VAM normally, breast hard colliders in Naturalis are always enabled.
