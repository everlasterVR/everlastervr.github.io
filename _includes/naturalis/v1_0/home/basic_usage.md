The softness, quickness and joint mass offset sliders are intended as easy and intuitive ways to change how breasts and glutes should behave. They adjust many different settings in the background, affecting the overall physics, collision and morphing.

### Softness

Softness affects how easily breasts and glutes deform and how jiggly they are. The effect of softness is much more noticeable when soft physics is enabled.

### Quickness

Quickness affects a few physics settings that determine how quickly breasts and glutes move.

### Mass

During calibration, mass is automatically calculated from an estimate of the volume of the breasts or glutes. The mass offset slider allows you to increase or decrease the mass relative to the calculated mass.
