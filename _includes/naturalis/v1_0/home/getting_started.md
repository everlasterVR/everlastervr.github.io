1. [Install the package](/docs/general/installing_addon_packages/)
2. Start VAM and add Naturalis.cslist to a Person atom's Plugins tab. See also [Auto-Upgrading](./auto_upgrading/).

The plugin's default settings are intended to work well in most situations.

Make sure your frame rate is sufficiently high and synchronized with VAM's physics rate - see [Physics Rate and Frame Rate](/docs/general/physics_rate_and_frame_rate/). Configure your setup correctly and you will get more out of the plugin!
